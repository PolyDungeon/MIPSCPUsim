This project requires Windows to run. If needed, I will create a version that does not need it. I just ran out of time

Run CPU3300.exe to start. 
Enter your path to the file such as
"C:\Users\user\Documents\Code\CPU3300\test.dat"

the program will run through all the instructions

Problems:
memory does not properly work all the time
other??
